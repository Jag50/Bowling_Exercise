Bowling Ball problem:
Write a program to score a game of Ten-Pin Bowling. Include partial scoring!

Input: string (described below) representing a bowling game
Output: integer score

The scoring rules:

Each game, or "line" of bowling, includes ten turns, or "frames" for the bowler.

In each frame, the bowler gets up to two tries to knock down all ten pins.

If the first ball in a frame knocks down all ten pins, this is called a "strike". The frame is over. The score for the frame is ten plus the total of the pins knocked down in the next two balls.

If the second ball in a frame knocks down all ten pins,  this is called a "spare". The frame is over. The score for the frame is ten plus the number of pins knocked down in the next ball.

If, after both balls, there is still at least one of the ten pins standing the score for that frame is simply the total number of pins knocked down in those two balls.

If you get a spare in the last (10th) frame you get one  more bonus ball.

If you get a strike in the last (10th)  frame you get two more bonus balls.

These bonus throws are taken as part of the same turn.  If a bonus ball knocks down all the pins, the process  does not repeat. The bonus balls are only used to calculate the score of the final frame.

The game score is the total of all frame scores.

Examples:

X indicates a strike
/ indicates a spare
- indicates a miss
| indicates a frame boundary
The characters after the || indicate bonus balls

X|45|6/|-7
Frame 1 = 19 (X + 4 + 5)
Frame 2 = 9 (4 + 5)
Frame 3 = 10 (6 + 4 + 0)
Frame 4 = 7
Total = 45

34|62|9
5 ball bowled, 2 frame completed, 3rd frame incomplete
3 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 9
Total score == 24

X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X||XX
Ten strikes on the first ball of all ten frames.
Two bonus balls, both strikes.
Score for each frame == 10 + score for next two
balls == 10 + 10 + 10 == 30
Total score == 10 frames x 30 == 300

9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-||
Nine pins hit on the first ball of all ten frames.
Second ball of each frame misses last remaining pin.
No bonus balls.
Score for each frame == 9
Total score == 10 frames x 9 == 90

5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/||5
Five pins on the first ball of all ten frames.
Second ball of each frame hits all five remaining
pins, a spare.
One bonus ball, hits five pins.
Score for each frame == 10 + score for next one
ball == 10 + 5 == 15
Total score == 10 frames x 15 == 150

X|7/|9-|X|-8|8/|-6|X|X|X||81
Total score == 167

Requirements:
Solution should be runnable from the command prompt, passing the input string as an argument
Feel free to use multiple classes if you wish
Demonstrate TDD (e.g. via GitHub commits) have dependence’s running maven
Break issue into at least 2 tasks, when 1st task is finished create PR and have other person review it, and then merge once approved (don’t squash commits) - delete branch post PR merge (I.e. each part is different branch)
Include maven usage and demo code coverage (take screen shots of it to show its use during development, e.g. maybe with some red areas its helped you with?)
Ensure boundary conditions covered
